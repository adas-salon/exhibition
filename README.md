# Ada's Salon

`Ada's Salon` is a VR exhibition aiming to give visibility to women and non-binary people in computer science. Very often their contributions are overlooked or forgotten.

A group of students from the [HTW Berlin](https://fiw.htw-berlin.de/) build this exhibition to explore possibilities in VR and in-browser 3D to tell stories about the life, work, struggles and successes of these women and non-binary people. 

## How to contribute?
The project is open source. But this is not the development repository. Head over to [wit-exhibtion](https://github.com/wit-exhibition/exhibition) to start contributing.
